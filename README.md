ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @praneethmodulla

Praneeth, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, enjoys his free time by engaging in puzzle-solving games and pursuing coding projects.
He is passionate about tackling challenges such as Rubik's cube and Sudoku, and he also enjoys playing mobile puzzle games like Rop and Hocus.

During the past sizzling summer, he interned at Honeywell, where he wielded his coding wizardry to conjure up software that gives firefighters the 
ultimate cheat code for making lightning-fast decisions in emergencies. Picture this: Praneeth, saves the day and lives â€“ all with 
the power of his keyboard and a dash of geeky magic! ðŸ”¥ðŸ’»ðŸš’

Before that, he held a position at Intel as a Software Engineer, where his role involved crafting automation software tailored for Intel's manufacturing facilities. 
He engaged in close collaboration with engineering teams across the globe, engaging in brainstorming sessions to devise software remedies for the factory's automation systems.

Chasing bugs and chasing dreams, he's on a quest to code his way through the digital jungle! 
With a burning desire for tech and a knack for turning caffeine into code, he's on the hunt for thrilling opportunities to engineer some seriously excellent software. 
Team up with him and turn '404 errors' into 'success stories'!
